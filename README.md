# Acoustic-Beamforming
Various beamforming files written in MATLAB. Allows for convection, different types of steering vectors and more.

Requires time pressure signal of microphones as a matrix representation.
Use developCSM to construct CSM with a given sampling frequency.
Use any beamform algorithm to perform beamforming.
